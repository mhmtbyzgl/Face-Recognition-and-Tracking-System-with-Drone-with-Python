Put the pictures of the faces you want the drone to recognize in the "Faces" folder with the extensions ".jpg" or ".jpeg".
Then change the names of the pictures to face1, face2, face3, face4.
If you want to customize the names of the pictures. You should also change only the names face1, face2, face3, and face4 in the "Face_Recognition.py" file.
